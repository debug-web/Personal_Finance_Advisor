# Personal Finance Advisor - Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Many students and beginners struggle to manage their personal finances—tracking daily expenses, seeing where their money goes, and staying within a monthly budget. Without a simple, accessible tool, people often lose track of spending or exceed their planned budgets, making it difficult to save or make informed decisions.

## Scope of the Project

This project is a **basic command-line personal finance advisor** written in Python. It allows users to add spending records, view all transactions, get summaries by category (like Food, Travel, Shopping), and receive simple budget advice for each month. The entire application is just one Python file and is designed for beginners, storing all data in a CSV file for easy access.

## Target Users

- First-year computer science students learning Python
- College/university students who want to track their spending
- Anyone new to coding who wants to manage personal finances with a simple script
- Beginners who want to understand how CSV files and basic logic can create practical applications
